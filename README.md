# COMP-345-C-Team-10-project-assignment-1

Warzone Game Engine – C++ Project TEAM 10
Description : 
This project consists of implementing the core components of the Warzone game engine in C++.
The implementation follows an object-oriented design and is divided into five main parts: Map, Player, Orders, Cards, Game Engine
Each component is implemented in its own .h/.cpp file pair and includes a corresponding driver file to demonstrate its functionality.

Recall 

Specific design requirements

1. All data members of user-defined class type must be of pointer type.
2. All file names and the content of the files must be according to what is given in the description below.
3. All different parts must be implemented in their own separate .cpp/.h file duo.
   All functions’ implementation must be provided in the .cpp file (i.e. no inline functions are allowed).
5. All classes must implement a correct copy constructor, assignment operator, and stream insertion operator.
6. Memory leaks must be avoided.
7. Code must be documented using comments (user-defined classes, methods, free functions, operators).
8. If you use third-party libraries that are not available in the labs and require setup/installation,
   you may not assume to have help using them and you are entirely responsible for their proper installation for grading purposes.

Assignement INSTRUCTIONS

Your code must include a driver (i.e. a finle containing a main function) 
for each part that allows the marker to observe the execution of each part during the lab demonstration
The file submitted must be a .zip file containing all your C++ code
