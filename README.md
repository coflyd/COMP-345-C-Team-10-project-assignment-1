# COMP-345-C++-WarZone-Team10

Warzone Game – TEAM 10
Description : 
Description: This project consists of implementing the fundamentals of the Warzone game engine in C++. The implementation follows an object-oriented design and is divided into five parts for the five main project members:

1. Map (Constance FLEURY)
2. Player (Amir Hossein Shiri Deh Piri)
3. Orders (Hamed Vasheghani Farahani)
4. Cards (Tony Yacoub)
5. Game engine (Sitong Guo)

Reminder of instructions:

°   Each component is implemented in .h/.cpp format and includes a corresponding driver file to demonstrate its functionality.
°   All user-defined class data members must be of type pointer.
°   All classes must implement a copy constructor, assignment operator, and correct stream insertion operator.
°   Memory leaks must be avoided.
°   The code must be documented using comments (user-defined classes, methods, free functions, operators).
°   If you use third-party libraries that are not available in the labs and require configuration/installation, you cannot rely on assistance in using them and are entirely responsible for their correct installation for grading purposes.
° The file submitted must be a .zip file containing all your C++ code
